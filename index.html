          <p>I've spent the last four years building my company Inkshares from the ground up.  I'm passionate about building products that people love.</p>
          <p>If you're interested in my professional (or amateur) skill set, you can skip ahead to those chapters using the menu.</p> 
          <p>Otherwise, let me indulge you in a brief life story.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
          <p>I was born in Oakland. My parents met in Berkeley and started a publishing company. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
          <p>Starting a business in the Bay was hard back then, and my parents wanted to be closer to their roots on the East Coast. So we picked up and moved to North Carolina when I was just a tot. I grew up in the Raleigh Durham area and still consider it home.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
          <p>I studied Philosophy and Economics at Reed. I wrote my senior thesis on the metaphysics of material composition and the philosophy of language.</p>
          <p>Turns out I believe that material ordinary objects like tables and chairs really exist â€“ ain't philosophy something!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
          <p>After college I was an analyst and project manager at an economic consulting firm in Seattle.  Although most of our analyses were for our clients here is a research paper I did on wage disparities between the public and private sector.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
          <p>After a year of data wrangling and p-value hacking using SAS and Stata, I was burned out. I bought a one-way ticket to Costa Rica and started picking up odd-jobs doing websites (mostly LAMP stacks).</p>
